# üöÄ How to Restart Your Development Server

I can't directly restart your development server, but here's exactly what you need to do:

## Step 1: Stop the Current Server
In your terminal/command prompt where your development server is running:

**Press one of these key combinations:**
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + C`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + C`

You should see something like:
```
^C
‚úì Development server stopped
```

## Step 2: Restart the Server
Type one of these commands (try them in order until one works):

```bash
# Most common - try this first
npm run dev

# Alternative commands if the above doesn't work
yarn dev
pnpm dev
npm start
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Verify Server Started
You should see output similar to:
```
VITE v4.x.x ready in xxx ms

‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
```

## Step 4: Test Your Application
1. **Open your browser** to the local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`)
2. **Try the chatbot** - ask questions like:
   - "What tables do you have?"
   - "Show me some data"
   - "How many records are there?"

## ‚úÖ What Should Happen Now

With your Supabase credentials configured, your chatbot should now:
- ‚úÖ Connect to your actual Supabase database
- ‚úÖ Show real data instead of connection setup messages
- ‚úÖ Display the green "[Configured]" status for your API key

## ‚ùå If Something Goes Wrong

**Server won't start?**
- Make sure you're in the correct project directory
- Try `npx vite` instead
- Check that your `.env` file is in the project root

**Environment variables not loading?**
- Verify your `.env` file has no extra spaces
- Make sure variable names start with `VITE_`
- Try clearing your browser cache

**Still seeing connection setup messages?**
- Double-check your `.env` file format
- Ensure you've restarted the server completely
- Check browser console for any error messages
