# How to Refresh Your Figma Make Application

Since you're using Figma Make, you can't manually restart a development server like in a local environment. However, you can refresh the application to load your new Supabase environment variables.

## Option 1: Browser Refresh (Try This First)
1. **Save all your work** in Figma Make
2. **Refresh your browser page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R for hard refresh)
3. **Wait for the application to reload** completely
4. **Test the chatbot** - try asking "What tables do you have?"

## Option 2: Figma Make Restart
1. Look for a **"Restart"** or **"Refresh"** button in the Figma Make interface
2. This might be in:
   - The top toolbar
   - A settings menu
   - Next to the preview/run button
3. Click it to restart the application environment

## Option 3: Re-run/Preview
1. Look for a **"Run"** or **"Preview"** button in Figma Make
2. Click it to re-initialize the application
3. This should pick up your new environment variables

## Option 4: Force Refresh Environment Variables
If the above don't work, I can update the code to force-reload the environment:

```javascript
// This forces the application to re-check environment variables
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.location.reload();
}
```

## What Should Happen After Refresh

Once the environment is refreshed, your chatbot should:
- âœ… **Connect to your Supabase database**
- âœ… **Show "[Configured]" status** for API key in connection details
- âœ… **Provide real data responses** instead of setup instructions
- âœ… **Query your actual database tables**

## Testing Your Connection

After refreshing, try asking these questions:
- "What tables do you have?"
- "Show me some data"
- "How many records are there?"
- "What's the database schema?"

## Troubleshooting

### If it still shows setup messages:
1. **Check your .env file** - make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes
2. **Verify the environment variables** are exactly:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://fspyevjjyfznpnvbprvs.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```
3. **Try a hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+F5)

### If you see connection errors:
- Your Supabase project might not have any tables yet
- Try creating a simple table in your Supabase dashboard first

## Creating a Test Table (Optional)

If you want to test with actual data:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Table Editor**
4. **Create a new table** called "users" with columns:
   - `id` (int8, primary key)
   - `name` (text)
   - `email` (text)
   - `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
5. **Add some sample rows**
6. **Test the chatbot** again

The key is that Figma Make needs to reload the application environment to pick up your new environment variables! ðŸš€
