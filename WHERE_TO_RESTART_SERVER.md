# Where to Restart Your Development Server

## 📍 Location: Project Root Directory

You need to restart your development server from the **project root directory** - the same folder that contains:

- ✅ `.env` file (your Supabase environment variables)
- ✅ `App.tsx` (your main application file)  
- ✅ `package.json` (your project dependencies)
- ✅ `components/` folder
- ✅ `styles/` folder

## 🔍 How to Find the Right Directory

### Option 1: Using File Explorer/Finder
1. Navigate to the folder that contains all these files together
2. You should see the `.env` file you just updated
3. This is your project root directory

### Option 2: Using Terminal/Command Prompt
If you're already in a subdirectory, navigate up to the project root:

```bash
# If you're in a subfolder, go back to the root
cd ..

# Or go directly to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# Check if you're in the right place - you should see these files:
ls -la
# (Windows: dir)

# You should see:
# .env
# App.tsx
# components/
# styles/
# package.json
```

## ⚡ Restart Commands

Once you're in the correct directory, run:

### Most Common (try first):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Alternative Commands:
```bash
# If using yarn
yarn dev

# If using pnpm  
pnpm dev

# Alternative npm commands
npm start
npm run start
```

## ✅ Verify You're in the Right Place

Before restarting, make sure you can see your updated `.env` file:

```bash
# Check if your .env file exists and has the right content
cat .env
# (Windows: type .env)

# You should see:
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://fspyevjjyfznpnvbprvs.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

## 🎯 Expected Output After Restart

You should see something like:
```
VITE v4.x.x ready in xxx ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h to show help
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get "command not found":
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Try `npx vite` instead
- Check if you have a `package.json` file in the current directory

### If the server starts but environment variables don't load:
- Double-check you're in the same directory as your `.env` file
- Restart your terminal/command prompt
- Clear your browser cache

Your project structure shows you have everything set up correctly - just make sure you're running the restart command from the root directory! 🚀
